# About Project
It is the web interface of a temperature-detecting Arduino device. It was developed using Asp.net core MVC and Entity Framework. It was made in 2022 and uploaded to Github again in 2024.

## Mission
I prepared this project as a web interface to work with an Arduino device that measures temperature. The interface will measure the temperature at regular intervals and send the measured temperature to our interface. If there is an extreme increase or decrease in temperature, warning messages will be sent to the specified phone number and e-mail addresses. The purpose of this application is to monitor sudden temperature changes in places such as cold storage, pharmacy warehouses and notify the person in charge.
